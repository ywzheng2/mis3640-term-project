# MIS3640 term project
## Term Project - Neha and Yuwei 
## Project Proposal

1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal? 

    The primary purpose of our project will be to predict stock prices and make recommendations to a user. Specifically, we hope to gather input data from the user including information regarding their preferences, industries of interest, the amount available to invest, etc, and then utilize this data along with our price predictions to make recommendations to the user. Our project would primarily be geared toward people who are first-time investors or new to the investing world. Our minimal viable product would be to create a program that performs the stated function, and our stretch goal would be to create an appealing/attractive UI for the program to make it more user-friendly. 

#
2. Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

    Through this project, we both have the shared general goal of understanding how the development and problem-solving process works in a group setting, meaning how we are able to combine our ideas, program, and compile assets together, etc. Individually, we both hope to continue to learn more about the field of data science within the context of problem-solving, specific libraries like pandas and numpy, and to continue to become stronger programmers in general.
#

3. Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

    -These library/framework will be used for data structure: Numpy; pandasâ€™ quantdsl; statistics; 

    -There library/framework will be used for calculating the Pricing: PyQL; pyfin; vollib; QuantPy; Finance-Python; ffn; pynance; tia; hasura; finta; Tulipy

    -These library/framework will be used for calendars: trading_calendars; bizdays; and pandas_market_calendars

    -These library/framework will be used for obtaining data: findatapy; googlefinance; yahoo-finance; pandas-datareader; pandas-finance

    -These library/framework will be for visualization: D-Tale

4. Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

    Week 1: Gather all the information/data needed for the project

    Week 2: Install all the modules/libraries needed

    Week 3: Sorting the data 

    Week 4: Model creation

    Week 5:Training the model 

    Week 6: Create a website 
    
    Week 7: Test the code

    Week 8: Complete the website  

# 
5. Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.

    We intend to meet once a week on Thursdays after the class session for about 1 hour (or more as needed). We hope to use these meetings to combine whatever individual work we may have done throughout the week, to discuss our progress on the project and any changes that need to be made, and to plan out what we both will individually work on for the following week. During our meetings, we will likely create pseudocode for the tasks that we are both going to be working on for the following week to make sure that we are both on the same page. Because our project consists of several different components (inputs from the user, analysis or prices, recommendations, etc.), we feel that this type of method works best. We also intend to communicate with each other throughout the week as needed through Facebook messenger.

6. Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

    -Coronavirus has a great impact on the stock market, so our model might not provide accurate predictions.

    -We also understand that our project is fairly ambitious given the many components it contains, so we realize that we will need to self-learn many concepts throughout the proc

7. Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
